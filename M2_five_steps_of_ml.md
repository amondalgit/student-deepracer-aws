# Five steps of Machine Learning
    define the problem -> build the dataset -> train the model-> evaluate the model -> use the model

1. ## Define the Problem
>### ML tasks (most common)
>1. Supervised Learning (uses label)
>    1. Classification (if solution labels are categotical variable)
>    2. Regression (if solution labels are continuous variable)
>2. Unsupervised Learning (uses unlabelled data)
>    1. Clustering (find any naturally occuring group in the data)

2. ## Build the Dataset
