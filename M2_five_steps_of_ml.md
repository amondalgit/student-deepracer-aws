## Introduction
    define the problem -> build the dataset -> train the model-> evaluate the model -> use the model

### ML tasks (most common)
1. Supervised Learning (uses label)
    1. Classification (if solution labels are categotical variable)
    2. Regression (if dsolution labels are continuous variable)
2. Unsupervised Learning (uses unlabelled data)
    1. Clustering (find any naturally occuring group in the data)
