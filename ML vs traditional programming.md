## How is machine learning different?
    > In traditional problem-solving with software, a person analyzes a problem and engineers a solution in code to solve that problem. For many real-world problems, this process can be laborious (or even impossible) because a correct solution would need to take a vast number of edge cases into consideration.

    > In machine learning, the problem solver abstracts away part of their solution as a flexible component called a model, and uses a special program called a model training algorithm to adjust that model to real-world data. The result is a trained model which can be used to predict outcomes that are not part of the dataset used to train it.
